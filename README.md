# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is an application to help students in the University of Toronto Coding Bootcamp. It is meant as an assisting tool to support their learning throughout the bootcamp.

This project was also created to learn basic coding concepts through a real-world application. Completing this project has helped me to build a foundation that will be useful as I continue in the bootcamp.
